# JavaScript30 CSS & JS Variables

This project is a part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos, where participants build 30 different projects using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. In this particular project, we've created a simple project allowing us to use CSS and JS variables to manipulate an item on the page.
